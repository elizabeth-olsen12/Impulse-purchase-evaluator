Impulse Purchase Evaluator

RabattDigga.de designed the Impulse Purchase Evaluator to help shoppers pause and think before making a purchase. Just enter the product price, your monthly income, whether it’s a need or a want, and your current mood.

The tool calculates how many hours you’d need to work to afford the item, helping you understand its real cost in time.

As one of Germany’s top coupon websites focused on saving your money, **RabattDigga.de** built this tool to encourage smarter, more mindful shopping.
